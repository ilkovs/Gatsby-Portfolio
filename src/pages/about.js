        <div className="about-main">
            <p>Born and raised in the beautiful country of Bulgaria, I've always had passion for technologies, websites and what's behind all that.
               Fortunately, due to life circumstances, I had the chance to move the USA and graduate as a Full Stack Web Developer from the Georgia Tech Coding Boot Camp and I have to admit, I've never felt so fulfilled and completed in my life.
                That moment when you realize that you finally found your profession, the only job that makes you feel good.<br /><br />
                My current position as a Jr Web Developer includes building and maintaining online stores on daily basis. Being a part of a large international team has been very beneficial for my development growth as far as meeting client expectations, deadlines and developing sites based on design mockups.<br /><br />
                Using E-Commerce, organizations can expand their market to national and international markets with minimum capital investment. E-commerce helps organization to provide better customer services. It simplifies the business processes and makes them faster and efficient. With that being said, my expertise can be used on multiple levels - development, business planning, marketing and consultancy.<br /><br />
                Where do I see myself in five years ? <br />
                 - My goal for the near future is to gain as much development experience as possible, to be a part of a large Dev team with limitless growing opportunities. Learning new languages, methods, libraries, frameworks is always a challenge I would go for. Let's talk!
