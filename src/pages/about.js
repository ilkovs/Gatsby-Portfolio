      <p>
        Born and raised in the beautiful country of Bulgaria, I've always had
        passion for technologies, websites and what's behind all that.
        Fortunately, due to life circumstances, I had the chance to move the USA
        and graduate as a Full Stack Web Developer from the Georgia Tech Coding
        Boot Camp and I have to admit, I've never felt so fulfilled and
        completed in my life. That moment when you realize that you finally
        found your profession, the only job that makes you feel good.
        <br />
        <br />
        My current position as a React Developer includes building React
        components as part of AJC’s newly adopted Article Page Builder (ARC
        publishing, created by Amazon), working closely with ARC’s development
        team for ensuring all good practices and requirements are met, building
        Vendors status page to ensure the team is alerted (via email, slack
        notification and SMS) if there’s an active incident with one of the
        services, working in an Agile Environment.
        <br /><br />
        My previous position as an E-Commerce Web Developer gave me the
        opportunity to gain knowledge and experience in the world of online
        shopping. My daily tasks included full time project development, store
        maintenance and updates, development of new features for specific
        business needs, Big Commerce API work, store management and more.
        <br /><br />
        Where do I see myself in five years ? <br />- My goal for the near
        future is to gain as much development experience as possible, to be a
        part of a large Dev team with limitless growing opportunities. Learning
        new languages, methods, libraries, frameworks is always a challenge I
        would go for. Feel free to shoot me a message using the contact form! Let's talk!
