      <p>
        Born and raised in the beautiful country of Bulgaria, I've always had
        passion for technologies, websites and what's behind all that.
        Fortunately, due to life circumstances, I had the chance to move to the USA
        and graduate as a Full Stack Web Developer from the Georgia Tech Coding
        Boot Camp and I have to admit, I've never felt so fulfilled and
        completed in my life. That moment when you realize that you finally
        found your profession, the only job that makes you feel good.
        <br />
        <br />
        My current position as a Software Engineer at Carputty includes building various components and features,
        improving UX, troubleshooting bugs, updating and deploying DB changes, building internal APIs and endpoints and more..
